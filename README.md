# Leetcode-cpp-solutions
This repository contains the solutions of Leetcode questions solved by me on daily/regular basis. 

This is my Leetcode profile :- https://leetcode.com/u/aastha-bhatia/

Usually, I do Leetcode using Java language. So, https://github.com/Aastha-Bhatia/Leetcode-Solutions/tree/main/Leetcode-java-solutions has more solutions and may help you more. 

However, there are some solutions in C++ language also https://github.com/Aastha-Bhatia/Leetcode-Solutions/tree/main/Leetcode-java-solutions/Leetcode-cpp-solutions which may help you :)

What you can also do is, understand the logic or approach from Java Solutions and you can convert it into C++ solution on your own...
